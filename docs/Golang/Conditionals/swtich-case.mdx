# Switch Statements
Go also has `switch` statements which are a more elegant way to write multiple `if-else` statements. The syntax is as follows:
```go
switch VARIABLE {
case VALUE1:
    // code to execute if VARIABLE == VALUE1
case VALUE2:
    // code to execute if VARIABLE == VALUE2
default:
    // code to execute if VARIABLE doesn't match any case
}
```


```go title="Example"
func getCreator(os string) string {
    var creator string
    switch os {
    case "linux":
        creator = "Linus Torvalds"
    case "windows":
        creator = "Bill Gates"
    case "mac":
        creator = "A Steve"
    default:
        creator = "Unknown"
    }
    return creator
}
```

Notice that in Go, the `break` statement is not required at the end of each case block. Go automatically breaks out of the switch after executing a case.

If you do want a case to fallthrough to the next case, you can use the `fallthrough` keyword explicitly.

```go
func getCreator(os string) string {
    var creator string
    switch os {
    case "linux":
        creator = "Linus Torvalds"
    case "windows":
        creator = "Bill Gates"
    
    // all three cases will set creator to "A Steve" 
    case "macOS":
        fallthrough
    case "Mac OS X":
        fallthrough
    case "mac":
        creator = "A Steve"
    default:
        creator = "Unknown"
    }
    return creator
}
```

The `default` case does what you'd expect - it runs if no other case matches.
