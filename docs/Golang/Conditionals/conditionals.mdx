# Conditionals
`if` statements in Go do not use the parentheses `()` around the condition, but the curly braces `{}` are required for the block of code to execute.

```go
if height > 4 {
    fmt.Println("You can ride the roller coaster!")
}
```

`else if` and `else` are also the same as u might expect:
```go
if height > 4 {
    fmt.Println("You can ride the roller coaster!")
} else if height == 4 {
    fmt.Println("You just meet the height requirement, but be careful!")
} else {
    fmt.Println("Sorry, you are not tall enough to ride.")
}
```

:::warning
Unlike other languages, in go u can't put the statring curly brace `{` on the next line. It must be on the same line as the `if`, `else if`, or `else` statement.
:::

## Initial Statement in If Block
An `initial statement` is a statement that executes before the condition is evaluated in an `if` statement. This allows you to declare and initialize variables that are only needed within that scope/block.
 
```go 
if INITIAL_STATEMENT; CONDITION {    
}
```

### Why would i use this?
- First it is a bit shorter and cleaner in visibility
- Second it limits the scope of the variable

For example instead fo writing like this
```go
length := getLength(email)
if length < 1 {
    fmt.Println("Email is invalid")
}
```
You can write like this
```go
if length := getLength(email); length < 1 {
    fmt.Println("Email is invalid")
}
```

In the above example, `length` is not available in parent scope, which is good as we only wanted it to use in this scope only and not elsewhere in the program.

        "To speed up my code",

<Quiz
  question="Which is valid Go syntax?"
  options={[
    "if x := 5; x > 3 {",
    "if (x := 5; x > 3) {"
  ]}
  correctIndex={0}
  explanation="In Go, the correct syntax for an if statement with an initial statement is `if x := 5; x > 3 {`. The parentheses around the condition are not used in Go's if statements."
