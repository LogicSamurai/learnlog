# Type Sizes

Integers, units, floats, and complex numbers all have sizes. 

- Signed integers: `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`
- Unsigned integers (non-negative numbers/no decimal): `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`, `uintptr`
- Floating-point numbers: `float32`, `float64`
- Complex numbers: `complex64`, `complex128`

## What about the sizes?

The size (8, 16, 32, 64, 128) indicates how many bits in memory will be used to store the variable. The default `int` and `uint` types refer to their respective 32 or 64-bit sizes depending on the platform (windows, linux, mac and their versions/specs).

The standard sizes that should be used unless you have specific performance need (eg. should be less memory usage one...)

## Type Conversion

Some types can be easily converted to other types, but some cannot. For example, you can convert an `int` to a `float64`, but you cannot convert a `string` to an `int` without parsing it first.

```go
temperatureFloat := 88.26
temperatureInt := int(temperatureFloat) // This will truncate the decimal part and give you 88
```

## Quiz

<Quiz
  question="When should you elect to NOT use a 'default type'?"
  options={[
    "When performance and memory are the primary concern",
    "When my system has lots of extra hardware I want to utilize",
    "When either a 'default' or a specific size will work"
  ]}
  correctIndex={0}
  explanation="You should elect to NOT use a 'default type' when performance and memory are the primary concern. Using specific types like `int8` or `float32` can help optimize memory usage and improve performance in certain cases, especially when dealing with large datasets or performance-critical applications."
