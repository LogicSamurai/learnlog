# Constants

Constants are like variables but their value **cannot be changed** after they are declared. They are declared using the `const` keyword.

## Declaring Constants

```go
const pi = 3.14159
const appName = "LearnLog"
const maxUsers = 1000
```

### Constants vs Variables

| Feature | Constants (`const`) | Variables (`var`) |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Can change value | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Must be known at compile time | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Type inference | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Can use `:=` | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

## Computed Constants

Constants can be computed using expressions, but only if the computation can be done at **compile time**:

```go
const firstName = "John"
const lastName = "Doe"
const fullName = firstName + " " + lastName // OK - computed at compile time

const secondsInMinute = 60
const minutesInHour = 60
const secondsInHour = secondsInMinute * minutesInHour // OK - computed at compile time
```

### What WON'T Work

You can't declare a constant that can only be computed at runtime:

```go
// ❌ This will NOT compile
const currentTime = time.Now() // Error: time.Now() is evaluated at runtime

// ✅ This works - use a variable instead
var currentTime = time.Now()
```

## Grouped Constants

You can group related constants together:

```go
const (
    StatusPending   = "pending"
    StatusApproved  = "approved"
    StatusRejected  = "rejected"
)

const (
    KB = 1024
    MB = KB * 1024
    GB = MB * 1024
    TB = GB * 1024
)
```

## Practical Example

```go
package main

import "fmt"

const (
    appName    = "LearnLog"
    appVersion = "1.0.0"
    maxRetries = 3
)

func main() {
    fmt.Printf("Welcome to %s v%s\n", appName, appVersion)
    fmt.Printf("Maximum retry attempts: %d\n", maxRetries)
    
    // This would cause a compile error:
    // appVersion = "2.0.0" // Error: cannot assign to appVersion
}
```

```txt title="Output"
Welcome to LearnLog v1.0.0
Maximum retry attempts: 3
```

:::tip When to Use Constants
Use constants for values that:
- Never change (like Pi, app version, configuration limits)
- Are known at compile time
- Should be protected from accidental modification

## Quiz

<Quiz
  question="Why would `const currentTime = time.Now()` cause a compilation error?"
  options={[
    "time.Now() returns a string, not a valid constant type",
    "Constants cannot store time values",
    "time.Now() is evaluated at runtime, but constants must be known at compile time",
    "You need to use var instead of const for all function calls"
  ]}
  correctIndex={2}
  explanation="Constants in Go must have values that can be determined at compile time. Since time.Now() gets the current time when the program runs (runtime), it cannot be used to initialize a constant. Use a variable instead."
