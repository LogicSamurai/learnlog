# Declaring Variables

## Using var Keyword

```go
var mySkillIssues int
mySkillIssues = 42
```

The first line, `var mySkillIssues int`, defaults the `mySkillIssues` variable to its zero value, `0`. And the next line `mySkillIssues = 42` will override the value to `42`.

You can also declare and assign in one line:

```go
var mySkillIssues int = 42
```

## Short Variable Declaration (Walrus Operator)

Sad variable definition:
```go
var mySkillIssues int
mySkillIssues = 42
```

Short variable definition:
```go
mySkillIssues := 42
```

The walrus operator `:=` declares a new variable called `mySkillIssues` with value 42 and Go automatically identifies the type as `int` as the value `42` is an integer. Yay `type inference`!

### When to use Walrus Operator?

The `:=` (walrus operator) should be used almost everywhere possible, but the limitation is that we can't use it outside the function like `global/package scope`.

Type inference is based on value assigned:

```go 
myInt := 42              // int
myFloat := 3.14159       // float64
myString := "Hello!"     // string
myBool := true           // bool
```

## Same Line Declaration

In Go we can declare multiple variables on the same line:

```go
mileage, company := 25000, "Toyota"
```

The above is same as:

```go
mileage := 25000
company := "Toyota"
```

You can also use this with `var`:

```go
var age, name = 25, "John"
```

### Practical Example

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Multiple declarations on same line
    x, y, z := 1, 2, 3
    firstName, lastName := "John", "Doe"
    
    fmt.Printf("Coordinates: x=%d, y=%d, z=%d\n", x, y, z)
    fmt.Printf("Name: %s %s\n", firstName, lastName)
    
    // Swapping values (Go makes it easy!)
    x, y = y, x
    fmt.Printf("After swap: x=%d, y=%d\n", x, y)
}
```

```txt title="Output"
Coordinates: x=1, y=2, z=3
Name: John Doe
After swap: x=2, y=1
```

:::warning
You cannot use `:=` outside of a function. For package-level variables, you must use `var`.
