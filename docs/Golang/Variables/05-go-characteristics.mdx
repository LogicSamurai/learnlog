# Go Characteristics

## Statically Typed Language

Go is a **statically typed language**, which means the type of a variable is determined at compile time - before the code even runs. This helps our editor and compiler display type errors before the code is executed, catching bugs early in development.

```go title="Type checking in action"
package main

func main() {
    var age int = 25
    age = "twenty-five" // Compile error: cannot use "twenty-five" (string) as int
}
```

### Static vs Dynamic Typing

| Static Typing (Go, Java, C++) | Dynamic Typing (Python, JavaScript) |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Types checked at compile time | Types checked at runtime |
| Errors caught before running | Errors found when code executes |
| More verbose but safer | Less verbose but more error-prone |
| Better IDE support | More flexibility |

:::info 
Languages also have **strong** or **weak** typing, meaning stricter or weaker type checking rules. Go is **strongly** and **statically** typed.

## String Concatenation

Two strings can be concatenated using the `+` operator. But the compiler will not allow you to concatenate a string with an `int` or `float64`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    firstName := "John"
    lastName := "Doe"
    
    // This works - string + string
    fullName := firstName + " " + lastName
    fmt.Println(fullName) // Output: John Doe
    
    // This would NOT work - string + int
    // age := 25
    // greeting := "I am " + age // Compile error!
    
    // Instead, use fmt.Sprintf
    age := 25
    greeting := fmt.Sprintf("I am %d years old", age)
    fmt.Println(greeting) // Output: I am 25 years old
}
```

## Compiled vs. Interpreted

**Compiled languages:** Code is compiled into an executable file using a compiler. This executable can run on any compatible machine without the source code.

**Interpreted languages:** Source code is executed directly by an interpreter, which translates it into machine code on the fly.

| Compiled (Go, C, C++, Rust) | Interpreted (Python, JavaScript, Ruby) |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Faster execution | Slower execution |
| Requires compilation step | Runs directly |
| Portable executables | Needs interpreter installed |
| Harder to debug sometimes | Easier to debug line-by-line |

### Visual Comparison

```txt title="Compiled Language Flow"
Source Code (.go) → Compiler → Executable (.exe) → Run
```

```txt title="Interpreted Language Flow"
Source Code (.py) → Interpreter → Run (line by line)
```

### Why Go is Special

Go combines the best of both worlds:
- **Fast like compiled languages** - produces native machine code
- **Quick compilation** - compiles almost as fast as interpreted languages
- **Cross-compilation** - can compile for different OS/architectures from one machine

```bash
# Compile for different platforms from one machine!
GOOS=windows go build -o myapp.exe
GOOS=linux go build -o myapp
GOOS=darwin go build -o myapp-mac
```
